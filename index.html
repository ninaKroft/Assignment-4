            <h2 class="subtitle">What is aerospace engineering?</h2>
            <p class="text">Aerospace engineers design and develop anything that flies inside or outside  <img align="right" src="./images/plane.webp" alt="airplane" style="width:20; height:15;" ><br>
              of the atmosphere, as well as the programs that controlls the systems. Two seperate <br>
              branches were created to divide aircraft and spacecraft. These branches are: astronautical <br>
              engineering - which deals with everything that flies outside of the atmosphere - and <br>
              aeronautical engineering - which deals with everything that flies within the atmosphere. <br>
              Because of the size and complexity of these projects, they are usually worked on by a team of engineers.</p>
            <h2 class="subtitle">Education required</h2>
            <p class="text">To become an aerospace engineer, you are required to go to university and to <img align="right"src="./images/satellite.png" alt="satellite" style="width:20; height:15;"><br>
              have at least a bachelor's degree, which can take 4 years to complete. You can expect <br>
              to spend 2 years to earn a master's degree, then an additional 3 years to earn a Ph.D. <br>
              Some universities offer courses specific to astronautical and aeronautical engineering, but <br>
              most universities offer an aerospace engineering course which covers both branches.</p>

          <h2 class="subtitle">Job outlook for aerospace engineering</h2>
          <p class="text">There are many future job opportunities in the future for aerospace engineers, <br>
            because it is a growing field of work that is very unlikely to be replaced by computers. <br>
            The employment of aerospace engineers is expected to grow by 6% from 2021 to 2031, which is <br>
            as fast as average. There are predicted to be 3,800 openings for this field every year on <br>
            average over the next ten years.</p>
          <br>
          <h2 class="subtitle">Salary range</h2>
          <p class="text">The average yearly salary for an aerospace engineer in Canada is $108,625, which <br>
            is around $55.67 per hour. Entry level salaries are around $87,263 per year, while the <br>
            highest earners earn around $157,663 per year.</p>

        <br>
        <h2 class="subtitle">Entrance requirements</h2>
        <p class="text">To be eligible to apply for the aerospace engineering course at Carleton University, <br>
          you need to take a minimum of six 4U/M courses. Four of these courses must be: advanced <br>
          functions, chemistry, physics, and one of the following: calculus and vectors, biology, or <br>
          earth and space science. Also, you must have your Ontario high school diploma (OSSD) or equivalent.</p>

            <p class="subtitle">How would a career in aerospace engineering have a positive impact on the people around me?</p>
            <p class="text">The technology that aerospace engineers design and maintain play <br>
              a large role in human society. By improving aircraft so that they are faster, <br>
              safer, and more fuel efficient, aerospace engineers are making people's quality <br>
              of life and security in the air better. Also, the spacecraft that they build not <br>
              only provide a sense of wonder, but also provide valuable data that help give us insight<br>
              on our world. As example, there are weather satellites that are collecting valuable <br>
              data on the composition of the Earth's atmosphere, which helps climate activists <br>
              and scientists come up with solutions to global warming while keeping big contributors accountable.</p>
