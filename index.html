            <h2 class="subtitle">What is aerospace engineering?</h2>
            <p class="text">Aerospace engineers design and develop anything that flies inside or outside of the atmosphere. Two seperate branches were created to divide aircraft and spacecraft. These branches are: astronautical engineering - which deals with everything that flies outside of the atmosphere - and aeronautical engineering - which deals with everything that flies within the atmosphere. Because of the size and complexity of these projects, they are usually worked on by a team of engineers.</p>
            <br>
            <h2 class="subtitle">Education required</h2>
            <p class="text">To become an aerospace engineer, you are required to go to university and to have at least a bachelor's degree, which can take 4 years to complete. You can expect to spend 2 years to earn a master's degree, then an additional 3 years to earn a Ph.D. Some universities offer courses specific to astronautical and aeronautical engineering, but most universities offer an aerospace engineering course which covers both branches.</p>

          <h2 class="subtitle">Job outlook for aerospace engineering</h2>
          <p class="text">There are many future job opportunities in the future for aerospace engineers, because it is a growing field of work that is very unlikely to be replaced by computers. The employment of aerospace engineers is expected to grow by 6% from 2021 to 2031, which is as fast as average. There are predicted to be 3,800 openings for this field every year on average over the next ten years.</p>
          <br>
          <h2 class="subtitle">Salary range</h2>
          <p class="text">The average yearly salary for an aerospace engineer in Canada is $108,625, which is around $55.67 per hour. Entry level salaries are around $87,263 per year, while the highest earners earn around $157,663 per year.</p>

        <h1 class="title">Education at Carleton University</h1>
        <br>
        <h2 class="subtitle">Entrance requirements</h2>
        <p class="text">To be eligible to apply for the aerospace engineering course at Carleton University, you need to take a minimum of six 4U/M courses. Four of these courses must be: advanced functions, chemistry, physics, and one of the following: calculus and vectors, biology, or earth and space science. Also, you must have your Ontario high school diploma (OSSD) or equivalent.</p>
